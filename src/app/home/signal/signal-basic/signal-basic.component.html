    <h2>How to handle / bind Angular signals with 'input' of the html? (2024)</h2>

    <h3>If you want to use model for usage with ngModel (Recommended)</h3>
    <p>Need import FormsModule. Otherwise, Can't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a known property of 'input'</p>
    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="quantity1" />
    <br>
    {{quantity1()}}

    <h3>Using 'separated' ngModel</h3>

    <input type="text" [ngModel]="quantity2()" (ngModelChange)="onQuantitySelected($event)" />
    <br>
    {{quantity2()}}

    <h3>Using getter</h3>

    <textarea class="license-textarea" rows="5" cols="30" pInputTextarea [(ngModel)]="vm.licenseKey"
        (input)="onLicenseKeyEntry($event)" placeholder="Enter license key"></textarea>
    <br>
    {{updatedLicenseKey()}}

    <h3>Using 'wrapper' of a signal</h3>

    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]=myQuestion().question />
    <br>
    {{myQuestion().question}}

    <h2> Differences between model() and input()</h2>

    Both input() and model() functions are ways to define signal-based inputs in Angular, but they differ in a few ways:

    model() defines both an input and an output. The output's name is always the name of the input suffixed with Change
    to support two-way bindings. It will be up to the consumer of your directive to decide if they want to use just the
    input, just the output, or both.
    ModelSignal is a WritableSignal which means that its value can be changed from anywhere using the set and update
    methods. When a new value is assigned, the ModelSignal will emit to its output. This is different from InputSignal
    which is read-only and can only be changed through the template.
    Model inputs do not support input transforms while signal inputs do.
